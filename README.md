# VIRTUAL-MOUSE
This project implements a computer vision-based mouse controller using Python libraries like OpenCV and pynput. It captures webcam input, detects hand gestures, and translates them into mouse actions such as cursor movement and clicks. This enables intuitive computer interaction without the need for traditional input devices.
